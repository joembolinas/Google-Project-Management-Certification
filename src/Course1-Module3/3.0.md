## Google Project Management Certificate - Module 3 Summary

### 3.1. Introduction: The project Management Life Cycle and Methodologies

This section serves as a recap and introduction to the module's core concepts.

* **Recap:** Previous learning covered the definition of  **project management** , what a project is (and isn't), its value to businesses, when a project manager is necessary, the day-to-day responsibilities, and core skills needed for success.
* **Upcoming Topics:** The module will introduce the two most popular approaches to project management: **Waterfall** and  **Agile** . It will also cover the **project management life cycle** and its phases, along with different styles, scenarios, and factors that impact a project at any phase.
* **Learning Objectives:** Upon completion, you will be able to explain and follow the project life cycle, define and outline a project's phases and their tasks, compare different project management methodologies to determine effectiveness, and organize how a project is run according to various methodologies.

### 3.2. Exploring the Phases of the Project Life Cycle

No two projects are exactly the same, meaning there are many different ways to manage them, and not always one "right way".

* **Project Life Cycle:** This is the **basic structure** that guides a project in the right direction to ensure it stays on track.
* **Four Major Phases:** Most project life cycles follow the same four standard phases:

| Phase                                   | Description & Key Tasks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :-------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Initiate the project**       | This is the launchpad for the entire process. Key tasks include defining project goals and**deliverables**(specific tasks or outcomes). You must identify the**budget and resources**needed, the people involved, and any other details that might impact success. All this information is documented in one place to showcase the project's value and get approval to move forward. |
| **2. Make a plan**                | Creating a plan is**absolutely 100 percent essential**for every project. The plan outlines*how*you will meet the project goals. It must include a **budget** , a breakdown of all tasks, ways to communicate team roles and responsibilities, a **schedule** , necessary resources, and a strategy for handling problems or changes (risk management).                       |
| **3. Execute and complete tasks** | The project team's job is to complete the tasks. The**Project Manager's primary role**is different: monitor progress, keep the team motivated, and**remove any obstacles**that might come up so tasks are executed well and on time.                                                                                                                                                 |
| **4. Close the project**          | This phase is crucial for reflection and formality. It allows the team to**celebrate**their hard work and**evaluate how the project went**(making note of what worked and what didn't) to plan better for next time. It is also used to connect with external stakeholders and let them know what was accomplished.                                                                  |

* **Project Completion:** Some projects have a firm end date (e.g., a political campaign). Others are completed when the system is set up and working (e.g., implementing a new ordering system), after which the project is handed over to another group for day-to-day support and maintenance.
* **Instructor Insight/Anecdote:** The instructor shared an experience managing the creation of a dashboard. Once the final product was delivered, they transitioned the continued updating of data and maintenance to the respective teams, likening it to  **"turning over the keys of a newly built house to its new owner"** .

### 3.3. Case Study: The Significance of Each Project Phase

This case study highlights the serious consequences of rushing the project life cycle.

* **The Consequence of Rushing Initiation:** Jason, a PM, rushed a proposal for a VR training program request, estimating a standard cost ($200,000) and time (six weeks) without involving the engineers. The engineers later found the software wouldn't work with the client's platform. The true timeline was six months for development and six months for testing, costing  **over a million dollars** . The project failed before it even started because of the negative impact on budget, quality, and timeline caused by incorrect assumptions.
* **Actionable Tip:** When faced with a request for a quick proposal, the PM should request additional time to develop an accurate and reasonable proposal by consulting with key players (stakeholders and project team).
* **The Right Process (Initiating):** Proper initiation involves defining goals, gathering stakeholders, identifying skill sets, timeline, and cost, and documenting the value the project creates, ensuring approval from company leadership before submitting the final proposal.
* **The Right Process (Execution):** The PM’s role is to monitor the team, **break down any barriers** that would slow them down, communicate schedule and quality expectations, and gather client feedback.
* **The Right Process (Closing):** When successful, the PM must discuss and document **lessons learned** (what worked well and what could work better) and recognize the team's hard work (e.g., a small lunch gathering).
* **Key Takeaway:** It is the project manager's job to ensure leadership understands the **risk of not properly preparing** for a project.

### 3.5. Phases in Action: Initiating and Planning

* **Phase 1: Initiate the project**
  * **Deliverables:** Defining project goals makes details clear. Deliverables are **specific tasks or outcomes** (e.g., for a political campaign, raising $5,000 or getting 500 signatures).
  * **Resources:** Resources can include people, equipment, software programs, vendors, physical space, or locations—anything needed to complete the project.
  * **Project Proposal:** The PM records all details in the project proposal and gets approval from a decision maker or group before moving ahead.
* **Phase 2: Make a plan**
  * Key tasks include creating a budget, setting the schedule, establishing the team, and determining roles and responsibilities.
  * **Instructor Insight/Quote:**  **Deliberate planning is critical to a project's success** . An experienced project manager knows that  **plans always change** .
  * **Risk and Change:** The ability to adapt requires thinking and planning ahead. Common risks include scheduling delays, budget changes, technology/software requirements, legal issues, quality control, and access to resources. Planning is key to reducing these risks.
  * **Communication:** Communicate the plan to the team so they know their tasks and what to do if they run into problems. Also communicate the plan and progress to stakeholders interested in the project's success.

### 3.6. Phases in Action: Executing and Closing

* **Phase 3: Execute and complete tasks**
  * The PM manages overall progress, overseeing the team's efforts and ensuring everyone understands expectations and deadlines.
  * The PM helps remove obstacles and alerts the right people about potential delays.
  * **Practical Tip (Overcommunication):** The PM needs to communicate continually through meetings, written communications (memos, emails, chat tools), and working documents (task reports).  **"If in doubt, err on the side of overcommunication."** .
  * Adjustments: The PM must clearly communicate updates when making adjustments to the schedule, budget, and resource allocation.
* **Phase 4: Close the project**
  * This phase is often overlooked. Key closure tasks:
    * Check all tasks (including added work) are completed.
    * Ensure outstanding invoices are paid, resources are returned/accounted for, and project documentation is submitted.
    * Obtain **confirmation that the final outcome is acceptable** and that the person who asked for the project is satisfied. This is crucial for success.
    * Conduct a **retrospective** (reflection) to note **best practices** and learn how to manage more effectively next time.
    * Collect all project documentation (plans, reflections) and share final results with  **stakeholders** .
    * **Stakeholders:** People interested in and affected by the project's success (e.g., management, clients, users, community).  **Pro Tip: Stakeholders are like the VIPs of your project** .
    * Celebrate the team's effort (e.g., team-wide email or company party for big projects).
    * Formally move on from the project.
  * **Instructor Insight:** The PM's role is similar to a  **coach with a sports team** ; their guidance, communication, and team-building are what make the difference in a successful, high-performing team.

### 3.7. Summary of the Project Phases

The project life cycle is the path for your project from start to finish, with each phase building toward the next.

* **Initiate the project:** Questions to ask include: Who are the stakeholders? What are the client’s goals? What is the purpose, mission, and measurable objectives? What skills/resources are required? What will the project cost?.
* **Make a plan:** Identify major milestones and the tasks/deliverables that make them up. Build the schedule and create an itemized budget to manage resources, budget, materials, and timeline.
* **Execute the project:** Monitor the team, break down barriers, maintain awareness of expectations, adapt to changes, and address process weaknesses or training needs.
* **Close the project:** Identify that all requested outcomes are complete. Release the team, celebrate success, pass off remaining deliverables, get stakeholder approval, document lessons learned, and reflect on future improvements.
* **Key Takeaway:** Following the project life cycle ensures you are capturing customer expectations, setting up for success with a plan, executing tasks/addressing issues, and closing out to capture lessons learned.

### 3.9. Introduction to Project Management Methodologies

* **Project Management Methodology:** A set of guiding principles and processes for owning a project through its life cycle. They guide PMs on steps to take, tasks to complete, and principles for management.
* **Linear Approach:**
  * Definition: The previous phase or task  **must be completed before the next can start** .
  * Application: Works well for projects with clear goals and sequential processes, where changes are unlikely or costly (e.g., building a house—must complete the blueprint, then foundation, then walls, etc.). Sticking to the plan increases the likelihood of meeting deadlines.
* **Iterative Approach:**
  * Definition: More flexible, allowing some phases and tasks to  **overlap or happen at the same time** .
  * Application: Effective when the final outcome might change based on testing/feedback (e.g., producing a new TV show pilot, where adjustments are made while hiring actors and advertising starts). It anticipates changes, allows testing, and permits the delivery of parts of the project as they are completed.
* **Hybrid Approach:** Google often adopts a  **hybrid approach** , mixing and matching different methods depending on the project type.

### 3.10. Overview of Waterfall and Agile

**Waterfall (Traditional) Methodology**

* **Origin:** Created in the 1970s.
* **Concept:** Refers to the  **sequential ordering of phases** ; you complete one phase at a time down the line. It is a  **linear approach** .
* **Application:** Traditionally used in physical engineering disciplines (manufacturing, construction), product feature design, and app design.
* **Core Principle:** Follows an ordered set of steps linked to  **clearly defined expectations, resources, and goals that are not likely to change** .
* **Project Phases:** Initiating, Planning, Executing, and Closing.
* **When to Use:** When phases are clearly defined, tasks rely on sequential completion, or  **when changes are very expensive to implement once the project has started** .
* **Example:** Catering an event on a tight budget. Steps must be sequential: Confirm guest count -> define menu -> get approval -> order unreturnable ingredients. Extra upfront effort ensures success and avoids painful implementation changes.

**Agile Methodology**

* **Definition:** Means being able to  **move quickly and easily** ; refers to **flexibility** and the ability to change and adapt.
* **Origin:** Concepts emerged in the 1990s as a response to demands for faster product delivery (mainly software); officially named in 2001.
* **Process:** An **iterative approach** where many tasks are worked on simultaneously or phases overlap.
* **Terminology:** Tasks are completed in  **iterations** , which in **Scrum** (a form of Agile) are called  **sprints** . Sprints are **short chunks of time (usually one to four weeks)** focused on specific tasks.
* **Core Principle (Mindset):** Agile is more of a **mindset** than a series of steps. It focuses on effective, collaborative teams seeking **regular feedback from the client** to adjust as changes emerge and deliver value quickly.
* **When to Use:** When the client has a general idea but lacks a concrete picture, or for projects with  **high uncertainty and risk** .
* **Example:** Building a website. The team builds different parts in sprints and delivers them incrementally. The main homepage can launch immediately while other parts (e.g., blog) are built out later. This allows early feedback and reduces wasted efforts.

### 3.11. Comparing Waterfall and Agile Approaches

Understanding these differences is vital for determining the correct project approach and demonstrating knowledge in job interviews.

| Aspect                           | Waterfall (Traditional)                                                                                                                               | Agile                                                                                                                                       |
| :------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Project Manager's Role** | Serves as an**active leader**by prioritizing and assigning tasks.                                                                               | **Scrum Master**acts primarily as a **facilitator** , removing barriers. Team shares responsibility.                            |
| **Scope**                  | Deliverables and plans are**well-established and documented in the early stages** . Changes require a formal **change request process** . | Planning happens in shorter iterations, focusing on delivering value quickly. Subsequent iterations are adjusted based on feedback.         |
| **Schedule**               | Follows a mostly**linear path**through the standard phases (Initiating, Planning, Executing, Closing).                                          | Time is organized into phases called**Sprints**(defined duration with a set list of deliverables planned at the start).               |
| **Cost**                   | Costs are controlled by**careful estimation upfront**and close monitoring.                                                                      | Costs and schedule**could change with each iteration** .                                                                              |
| **Quality**                | Project manager defines criteria to measure quality**at the beginning**of the project.                                                          | Team solicits ongoing stakeholder input and user feedback by**testing products in the field**and regularly implementing improvements. |
| **Communication**          | Project manager continually communicates progress toward milestones to stakeholders.                                                                  | Team is customer-focused, with**consistent communication between users and the project team** .                                       |
| **Stakeholders**           | Project manager continually manages and monitors stakeholder engagement to ensure the project is on track.                                            | Team**frequently provides deliverables**to stakeholders throughout the project. Progress is dependent upon stakeholder feedback.      |

### 3.12. Introduction to Lean and Six Sigma

**Lean Six Sigma** combines the methodologies of Lean and Six Sigma.

* **Goals:** Used in projects aiming to  **save money, improve quality, and move through processes quickly** . It promotes team collaboration, leading to increased motivation and productivity.
* **DMAIC Process:** Lean Six Sigma follows five phases known as  **DMAIC** , a strategy for **process improvement** aimed at finding and fixing problems.

| Phase             | Description                                                                                                                                          | Key Actionable Takeaway                                                                        |
| :---------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **D**efine  | Define the project goal, expectations, and what it will take to meet it. Similar to the initiation phase.                                            | Example: Reduce average customer wait times from 30 minutes to**less than 10 minutes** . |
| **M**easure | Assess the current process performance, focusing on collecting**data** . Map out the process to locate where problems are and their effect.    | Gather data (e.g., wait times, customer volume). Plan how and how often to measure the data.   |
| **A**nalyze | Identify gaps and issues based on the collected data. This step provides a strong understanding of causes and potential solutions.                   | Example: Data analysis reveals inadequate staffing on peak customer days.                      |
| **I**mprove | Present findings and start making necessary modifications to the process. Process improvements should**only be made after careful analysis** . | Example: Modify staffing levels to address customer needs.                                     |
| **C**ontrol | Implement the new process and documentation, and maintain monitoring to ensure the company does not revert to old, inefficient ways.                 | Put new processes in place and monitor them continuously.                                      |

* **DMAIC Relationship:** "Defining tells you what to measure, measuring tells you what to analyze, analyzing tells you what to improve, and improving tells you what to control".
* **When to Use:** Ideal when the goal is improving the current process to fix **complex or high-risk problems** (e.g., improving sales, conversions, or eliminating a  **bottleneck** —where things get backed up). Following DMAIC prevents skipping important steps.
* **Google's Hybrid Approach:** Google teams mix methodologies. An engineering team might use **Agile** for product creation but **Waterfall** for planning/documentation. A customer service team might use **Lean Six Sigma** for analysis/improvement, but implement the new features using  **Agile iterations and sprints** . A training team might use solely **Waterfall** if requirements, deadlines, and goals are fixed (e.g., annual compliance training).
* **Biggest Takeaway:** Project managers must know the various methods and tools to confidently apply what works best for the project, team, and end goal.

### 3.13. Lean and Six Sigma Methodologies

#### Lean Methodology

* **Origin:** Originated in manufacturing (often called  **Lean Manufacturing** ).
* **Main Principle:** The **removal of waste** within an operation by optimizing process steps, ensuring only value is added.
* **Eight Types of Waste:** Defects, excess processing, overproduction, waiting, inventory, transportation, motion, and  **non-utilized talent** .
* **When to Use:** To use limited resources, reduce waste, and streamline processes for maximum benefits.
* **Lean 5S Quality Tool:** Refers to the five pillars for good housekeeping, aimed at cleaning up and organizing the workplace to achieve the smallest amount of wasted time and material.
  * **Sort:** Remove all items not needed for current operations (leave only essentials).
  * **Set in order:** Arrange needed items so they are easy to use; label them.
  * **Shine:** Keep everything clean and in the correct place every day.
  * **Standardize:** Perform the process the  **same way every time** .
  * **Sustain:** Make a habit of maintaining correct procedures and instill this discipline in the team.
* **Kanban Scheduling System (Kanban Board):** A core Lean method. It is a **visualization tool** that optimizes the flow of work. Tasks are represented by cards moved from left to right to show progress (e.g., "to do," "in progress," "done").

#### Six Sigma Methodology

* **Purpose:** Used to **reduce variations** by ensuring quality processes are followed every time.
* **Statistical Standard:** The term generally means that items or processes should achieve  **99.9996% quality** .
* **Seven Key Principles:** Focus on the customer; understand how work really happens; make processes flow smoothly; reduce waste/concentrate on value; stop defects by  **removing variation** ; involve and collaborate with your team; approach improvement systematically.
* **Application:** Inspect measurable product or process aspects (time, cost, quantity). Products not meeting the Six Sigma standard are rejected, and the process that created them must be improved.

#### Lean Six Sigma (Combined)

* The two methodologies were combined to increase benefits.
* Lean tools (like 5S and Kanban boards) build quality into processes from the start. Products developed using Lean are then inspected or tested using Six Sigma standards.
* **Key Difference:**  **Lean streamlines processes** , while **Six Sigma reduces variation** in products by building in quality and inspecting them.

### 3.14. Common Project Management Approaches and How to Select One

* **Scrum:** An **Agile framework** focusing on complex projects through collaboration, accountability, and iteration. Work is completed by small, cross-functional teams led by a **Scrum Master** and divided into short **Sprints** with set deliverables.
* **Kanban:** A tool used in both Agile and Lean.
* **Lean Six Sigma:** A combination of Lean (eliminating eight areas of waste using 5S and Kanban) and Six Sigma (reducing variations using DMAIC). It is ideal for solving complex or high-risk problems.
* **Commonality:** All methodologies require **communication and collaboration** and aim to deliver projects on time and within budget
