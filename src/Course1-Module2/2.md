# Reflection: Identify the essential skills of a project manager

Scenario: Planning a Corporate Retreat

```markdown

## Scenario: Planning a Corporate Retreat

An event planning team of five is tasked with planning a corporate retreat for a business with 85 employees. This retreat involves hundreds of to-dos, a large budget, client-initiated changes, and important discussions with the client. The project manager knows there is a lot to do, and they are ready to lead the way.

Right from the beginning of the project, the project manager creates a spreadsheet to track what needs to get done in the project, and what teammates are working on. They also send status update emails twice per week to the stakeholders.

The project has a $100,000 budget. There are many items to purchase and rent, including venue space, retreat materials, food, chairs, and tables. The project manager allows each one of their teammates up to $3,000 in expenses, with anything over requiring an approval. 

Shortly after the project begins, the client decides they want to slightly change the theme of the project to focus on the future instead of the past. The project manager has to work with several team members to implement the changes which include graphic design, retreat materials, and signage.

Throughout the process of changing the theme of the retreat, the project manager works closely with the client by phone, email, chat, and video to ensure that the theme updates meet their expectations.

There is an award-ceremony dinner at the end of the retreat. The deadline to finish scheduling the dinner is in two days. Several crucial decisions need to be made: the menu, lighting, and presentation music. To make sure the deadline is met, the project manager has a video meeting with the client to ensure the dinner choices meet their expectations.

3. Question 3
How did the project manager enable decision-making in the project? Write 1–3 sentences.

The project manager enabled decision-making by delegating spending authority up to $3,000 per teammate and maintaining direct communication with the client through multiple channels. When facing tight deadlines for the dinner event, they proactively scheduled a video meeting to make crucial decisions quickly.

Thank you for your response. If your response did not include the process for dealing with project expenses, you may want to consider how the project manager enables their team.

For instance, by giving each teammate a $3,000 purchasing limit, the project manager enables teammates to make decisions on what to buy for the retreat. If they didn't give the team this option, then the project manager would have to make all the final purchasing decisions themselves.

1 / 1 point

4. Question 4
How did the project manager communicate and escalate in the project? Write 1–3 sentences.

The project manager communicated through twice-weekly status emails and multiple channels with the client (phone, email, chat, video). They escalated by requiring approval for expenses over $3,000 and scheduling urgent client meetings when facing tight deadlines.

Thank you for your response. If your response did not include the final dinner scheduling, you may want to consider how the project manager dealt with that deadline.

When the deadline for the celebration dinner was approaching, the project manager scheduled a meeting with the client to escalate and communicate the decisions that needed to be made. If the project manager didn't escalate these decisions, it may have gone past the deadline to order food and materials for the dinner.

1 / 1 point

5. Question 5
How did the project manager remain flexible in the project? Write 1–3 sentences.

The project manager remained flexible by quickly adapting to the client's mid-project theme change from focusing on the past to the future. They coordinated with multiple team members to implement necessary updates across graphic design, retreat materials, and signage to accommodate this change.

Thank you for your response. If you did not include client change requests in your write-up, you may want to consider how the project manager addressed client expectations.

When the client requested to change the theme of the retreat, the project manager had to stay flexible. They worked with teammates to get the necessary changes in place quickly.

1 / 1 point

6. Question 6
How did the project manager use strong organizational skills in the project? Write 1–3 sentences.

The project manager used strong organizational skills by creating a tracking spreadsheet for tasks and team assignments, establishing twice-weekly status updates, and implementing clear budget management with defined spending limits.

Thank you for your response. If your response did not cover how the project manager used tools to stay organized, consider the following: The project manager created a spreadsheet to track and organize the tasks for the project.

They also used the tracker to assign tasks to specific team members. Sending status updates twice per week was also a way the project manager stayed organized. The status updates could also be viewed as a communication skill as well.

Question 1
In this exercise, you will read a scenario and comment about how you would react to the situation. Then, you will list and describe skills that make a project manager successful. Start by considering the following scenario:

A co-worker is responsible for researching and providing you with a list of potential venues for a retirement party. For the last three weeks, they have been telling you they will complete the list by "the end of the week (EOW)." When you check in with them at the beginning of each of the weeks, they tell you they didn't get around to completing it but that it will be done by the current week.

How might you influence this situation without authority? Write 2-3 sentences.

I would approach this by first having a direct but supportive conversation to understand what obstacles are preventing completion, then offer assistance or resources to help overcome those barriers. I'd also establish a more specific timeline with clear milestones, such as asking for a partial list by mid-week and the complete list by Friday, which creates accountability through smaller, manageable commitments. Additionally, I might emphasize the impact of the delay on the retirement party planning and the retiree, helping them understand the broader consequences of the postponement.

How did you do? Here are a few approaches we recommend:

Talk to your co-worker about the overall schedule for the retirement party, and explain to them how selecting a venue as soon as possible is critical to the success of the overall event and will determine what the date of the party will be.

Ask your co-worker about their current workload and see if there is anything you can do to free up their schedule. You can also offer to get someone else to help them, if needed.

Midweek, consider sending your co-worker a gentle reminder about their end of week commitment and ask how it's coming along.

Projects often involve competing priorities that lead to conflicts. Strong conflict resolution skills enable project managers to mediate disputes, find win-win solutions, and maintain productive relationships while keeping projects on track.

	5. Empathy
Understanding team members' perspectives and challenges allows project managers to provide appropriate support and create inclusive environments. Empathetic leaders can better motivate their teams and foster commitment to project success.


Here's a recap of the most valuable interpersonal skills we've discussed so far in the course.

Interpersonal skills:
Enabling decision making: The ability to enable decision making on the team, or gather decisions from the appropriate leader is crucial to keep projects on task and achieve their goals. As a project manager, you will need to enable decisions frequently.

Communicating and escalating: As a project manager, you'll use your communication skills in just about everything you do. And you need to know when it is appropriate to escalate, so that critical issues are raised and addressed as soon as possible to reduce negative impact on a project.

Remaining flexible: As a project manager, knowing how to be flexible when changes are needed is key. Plans will change — even with careful, upfront planning. As a project manager being flexible is critical to be able to course correct and adapt when the unexpected happens.

Organizational Skills: Having strong organizational skills means having the ability to organize the core elements of a project and ensure nothing gets lost or overlooked. A project manager needs to be organized so that they can manage a project and all of its moving parts.

Negotiation: As a project manager, you'll have to know how to balance the needs of your teammates with the needs of the project. For example, if a teammate says they can't complete their work on time, you may need to compromise on a deadline.

Conflict mediation: Resolving tension and conflict within a team is an important skill. This may involve setting up a meeting with two teammates that are struggling to agree upon the best way to handle a shared task.

Understanding motivations: Getting to know your teammates and figuring out what pushes them to their best work is an effective skill to have. Understanding motivations also involves understanding how your teammates prefer to receive feedback.
