## Module 2 Summary: Becoming an Effective Project Manager

### 2.1 Introduction Becoming an effective project manager

* **Module Goal:** To gain a deeper understanding of a project manager’s role.
* **Learning Objectives:** By the end of this module, you will be able to:
  * Explain the unique value a project manager brings to their team.
  * Describe a project manager's roles and responsibilities.
  * List a project manager's core skills.
* **Career Preparation:** The course helps learners recognize existing skills that contribute to success and identify new skills needed in preparation for a project management career.

### 2.2 The value of a project manager

* **Project Manager Definition:** Project managers **shepherd projects from start to finish** and serve as guides for their team, utilizing impeccable **organizational and interpersonal skills** every step of the way.
* **Core Process:** PMs follow a process that includes  **planning and organizing** ,  **managing tasks** , **budgeting, and controlling costs** to ensure the project is completed within the approved timeframe.
* **Key Ways PMs Add Value:** PMs play a crucial role by adding value through three key areas:
  1. **Prioritization:** PMs are experts at helping team members identify and break down large tasks into smaller steps. They gather information from teams and **stakeholders** (people interested in and affected by the project’s success, like company leaders) to determine which tasks are most critical.
     * *Practical Example:* Prioritizing laying out drop cloths and applying blue tape before starting to paint rooms.
  2. **Delegation:** PMs match tasks to the individuals who can best complete the work, applying knowledge of their team's strengths to the project planning.
     * *Practical Example:* Asking a friend with professional painting experience to handle challenging aspects like painting the ceiling or detailed molding.
  3. **Effective Communication:** PMs deliver value by being **transparent** (up front with plans and making information readily available) with the team and stakeholders. They keep regular contact to check on progress and identify where support is needed, ensuring the project stays on track.
     * *Practical Example:* Checking in with friends about supplies or informing a landlord about the project plans.

### 2.3 JuAnne Path to becoming a project manager

* **Personal Background:** JuAnne, a Senior Program Manager at Google, developed strong organizational skills early in life, having had to manage meals, homework, and chores by herself.
* **Career Path:** She started as a  **business systems analyst** , writing or gathering requirements for customers and translating them into documentation for engineers. She naturally transitioned into project management by starting to manage timelines, tasks, and understanding all the project pieces.
* **Instructor Insight (Focus on People):** The most enjoyable part of the job is working with diverse people and understanding how they interact and behave.
* **Actionable Advice:**  **Focus on the relationship** . If you understand your team members’ style, where they are coming from, and what their concerns are, you can adapt your communication and working style to be more receptive to them, making the project better overall.

### 2.4 How project managers impact organizations

Project managers add value and impact organizations through five key practices:

1. **Focusing on the Customer:**
   * **Customers** define requirements, budget, and deadlines. They can be **internal** (management, team members) or **external** (clients, suppliers).
   * PMs must build relationships with customers to ensure the project meets their standards and they are satisfied.
   * **Actionable Tip (Asking Questions):** Dig deeper into the "why" behind the project by asking: *What is the problem you would like us to help solve?* (e.g., developing a new efficiency process), *How is the problem impacting your organization?* (e.g., losing clients due to late orders), *What prompted you to ask for help now?* (e.g., risk of losing department funding), and *What is your hope for the outcome?* (e.g., increasing order speed without sacrificing quality).
2. **Building a Great Team:** The team is the project's biggest asset. PMs identify the **right team** based on the required skills. They ensure the team is successful by letting them have input and addressing their needs quickly, making them feel valued and trusted.
3. **Fostering Relationships and Communication:** These skills form the foundation for success. PMs set the tone by checking in daily and treating others with respect.
4. **Managing the Project:** Successful PMs see the **whole picture** and communicate the impact of each process to the team. This ensures team members understand the overall goal, enabling them to tailor their individual tasks.
5. **Breaking Down Barriers:** PMs should model ingenuity and collaboration. They add value by supporting their team to innovate new ways of working, rather than sticking to "Because we've always done it this way".
   * **Actionable Tip:** Advocate for additional resources or intervene directly to get answers from other parts of the organization, keeping the team on schedule.

### 2.5 Key project manager roles and responsibilities

Project management involves applying knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to meet requirements. Key responsibilities include:

* **Planning and Organizing:** Utilizing productivity tools, creating processes for information sharing, and developing **plans, timelines, schedules, and documentation** (which must be maintained throughout the project) to track completion.
* **Budgeting and Controlling Costs, and Other Factors:** Monitoring and managing the budget. Tracking issues and  **risks** , and mitigating quality issues. A crucial part is **removing unforeseen barriers** (things hindering progress), such as identifying a lack of resources, escalating the issue, and securing the necessary resource.
* **Managing Tasks:** Tracking tasks (activities accomplished within a set time) is essential for managing the team’s workload and demonstrating progress to stakeholders.
  * *Instructor Example:* Using separate **project trackers** for engineering teams to outline the curriculum vision, timeline, categories of work, and assigned members, while consistently updating stakeholders.

### 2.6 Responsibilities that utilize interpersonal skills

**Interpersonal skills** are behaviors used to interact with others, including communication, active listening, and leadership. Interpersonal responsibilities are just as important as concrete tasks like scheduling and budgeting.

* **Teaching and Mentoring:** Explaining expectations fully eliminates confusion and rework. Mentoring involves supporting individuals to meet expectations and exceed their personal potential.
* **Building Relationships:** Essential with team members and stakeholders. Dedicating time to check in, showing interest in their lives beyond the project, and noting their work styles fosters shared investment in project success.
* **Controlling Change:** Acknowledging that "The only thing that never changes is that everything changes" (Louis L’Amour quote).
  * PMs must remain flexible but are responsible for **protecting their team** from constant change and rework.
  * **Actionable Tip:** Document initial expectations, clearly identify requested changes, and ensure stakeholders understand the **budget and schedule impact** of those changes.
* **Empowering the Team:** Delegating responsibilities, allowing teams to make decisions, and utilizing their input shows trust and generates fresh ideas. Allowing the team to work directly with stakeholders can empower them.
* **Communicating Status and Concerns:** PMs set the tone by maintaining an  **open door policy** , building trust, and staying positive.

### 2.7 A project manager’s role within a team

* **Role Clarity:** The project manager is usually **not the direct manager** (boss) of the people working on the project team; they are responsible for managing the project tasks.
* **Expertise Distribution:** The PM is an expert in project management, but team members are experts in their specific portions (e.g., a graphic designer is an expert in design, not necessarily copywriting).
  * *Analogy:* Planning a camping trip involves assigning tent selection to the partner who is the camping expert.
* **PM Primary Job:** **Guiding the team** and ensuring they have the necessary support to complete the project.
* **Key Responsibilities for Guidance:**
  1. **Hold all team members accountable** for assigned tasks by giving them ownership.
  2. Establish **escalation paths** (knowing how to communicate risks to the right people at the right time) and ensure risks are tracked and visible.
  3. Help teammates adopt the appropriate  **workflows and project management styles** .
  4. **Collaborate with other teams** (e.g., marketing or finance) within the organization to meet requirements based on scope, schedule, and budget.

### 2.8 Working with cross-functional teams

* **Cross-Functional Team Definition:** Teams composed of members with different backgrounds, expertise, and job functions working toward a common goal.
* **T-Shaped Professionals:** Team members are sometimes called **"T-shaped professionals"** because they have deep knowledge in one area (vertical) and strong skills in collaboration across functions (horizontal).
* **PM Strategies for Success:**
  1. **Clarify Goals:** Be direct and concise, ensuring every member understands their role, how they support others, and the common project objectives, defining key items like budget and deadlines.
  2. **Get Team Members with the Right Skills:** Ensure the team contains the specific skill sets needed for the project functions (e.g., mechanics are needed alongside engineers for building an airplane).
  3. **Measure Progress:** Communicate accomplishments regularly to keep the team motivated and help them recognize their impact on the full project picture. Regularly check in and offer help if delays are anticipated.
  4. **Recognize Efforts:** Acknowledge the value of every team member's contribution, especially when some skills might get overlooked (e.g., recognizing the finance member who sourced funding, not just the technical expert).

### 2.9 Elita - A day in the life of a project manager

* **Memorable Quote/Metaphor:** A great project manager is "some funky combination of  **EMT, ninja, and jazz musician** ".
  * **EMT:** Triages chaos and develops a plan of action immediately.
  * **Ninja:** Must be **stealthy** in influencing others, as pushing people too hard isn't well received.
  * **Jazz Musician/Drummer:** Keeps a **steady beat** to ensure all surrounding talented players (engineers, product managers) work in time.
* **Day-to-Day Focus:** Communicating constantly with various stakeholders (product, engineering, sales, marketing). The **complexity** of topics and the **number of people** involved increase with experience.
* **Actionable Tip (Organization):**  **Staying organized is the most important thing** . "The more organized you are in your actions, the more organized your team is in their thinking and their actions".
  * **Technique:** Uses **lists all day long** (post-it notes, electronic lists) to prioritize actions and budget time.
* **Team Alignment:** Uses quick **stand-up meetings** (about 15 minutes, usually in the morning) to confirm what was done the previous day and what is planned for today.
* **Key Traits:** A **bias to action** and  **resilience** .
  * **Actionable Quote:** " **Pick it and stick it** ". This means making a decision to get unstuck, following through, learning from the action, and then having the resilience to change your mind based on new information.

### 2.10 The core skills of a project manager

There are four specific core skill sets essential for successful project managers:

1. **Enabling Decision-Making:** Crucial for keeping projects on schedule. PMs gather information and insights from teammates or leaders to help the team make informed decisions (e.g., choosing between choice A and choice B).
2. **Communicating and Escalating:** Essential for nearly every task, including documenting plans, sending status emails, and holding meetings to escalate risks or issues to stakeholders.
3. **Flexibility:** Knowing how to be flexible when changes are inevitable is key.
   * **Memorable Quote:** " **The only constant is change** ".
   * PMs must stay cool under pressure to adjust to unpredictable moments (like changing company goals or a team member leaving) and help the team remain calm.
4. **Strong Organizational Skills:** Necessary for organizing the many processes and core elements of a project to ensure nothing is lost or overlooked.
   * **Actionable Tip:** Track daily tasks in a spreadsheet or send frequent status updates.

* **Enhancing Skills:** Familiarity with industry knowledge, tools/templates, and popular styles like **Waterfall and Agile** helps PMs organize and document the project lifecycle. These core skills enforce team morale and accountability.

### 2.11 Key competencies Flexibility and handling ambiguity

This lesson emphasizes **flexibility** as a critical skill.

* **Deep Dive: Enabling Decision-Making:** Make the process  **collaborative** . Eliciting input on how to achieve goals empowers team members, fosters responsibility and  **accountability** , and allows the PM to focus on overarching management tasks.
* **Deep Dive: Communicating and Escalating:** When escalation is necessary, always approach management with **both the problem and the potential solution or suggestions** to demonstrate initiative.
* **Deep Dive: Strong Organizational Skills:** PMs must model organization by utilizing various tools:
  * **Planning and scheduling software** (templates, calendars)
  * **Collaboration tools** (dashboards)
  * **Documentation** (files, spreadsheets)
  * **Quality assurance tools** (productivity trackers).
* **Flexible Planning Strategies:**
  1. **Assess external constraints:** Account for holidays, vacations, and sick leave by leaving extra time ( **buffer** ) in the schedule upfront.
  2. **Plan for risks and challenges:** Anticipate solutions (e.g., pre-identify independent contractors if a team member quits). Review historical data to prepare for similar past challenges.
  3. **Calculate "Float" (Slack):** **Float** is the amount of time a task can be delayed before it impacts the project outcome. Identifying float helps with resource management and scheduling.
* **Handling Ambiguity:** PMs lead during times of uncertainty (ambiguous goals, requirements, or vision).
  * **Ways to Help the Team:**
    1. **Keep calm** and maintain poise.
    2. **Express empathy** and support.
    3. **Communicate what you know clearly:** Define confirmed aspects of the project.
    4. **Make decisions and stick to them:** Avoid second-guessing choices in front of the team.
    5. **Trust the expertise of your team:** Have team experts discuss known factors and brainstorm ways to gather information about unknowns.
* **Key Takeaway:** Mastering flexibility and the ability to handle ambiguity provides a competitive advantage and allows the PM to innovate and grow as a leader.

### 2.12 Rachel - My journey to becoming a project manager

* **Career Anecdote:** Rachel (Senior Program Manager, Google) was hired after befriending engineers who frequented the bar where she worked, who admired her advice and problem-solving skills.
* **Bartending to PM:** Her skills polished as a bartender informed her work. An old bartender taught her that a bar and a meeting room are similar: "People come into a bar like they come into a meeting room wanting to leave feeling something else".
* **Core Role:** Program management involves helping people through the experience of meeting, making decisions, and coming to conclusions together—similar to helping people have a better night as a bartender.
* **People Skills:** Her engineering partner recognized her ability to  **build a community** . Just like a bartender must talk to anyone who walks in (the customer) and understand their unique needs, a PM must talk to and understand the unique needs of subject matter experts (engineers, product designers, UX people).
* **Key Insight:** Program management is not just about the process and artifacts; it's about  **how you relate to people** . Skills learned in other areas of life (like de-escalating conflict or talking to people) are experiences that make a PM’s work unique.

### 2.13 Common myths about project managers

This lesson debunks common misconceptions about the role:

* **Myth 1: You have to be an expert in the field and have a lot of technical knowledge about the project.**
  * **Reality:** PMs look at the overall strategy and assess how all the pieces contribute to success. They hire experts (e.g., engineering, construction, plumbing, electrical) and trust them to focus on technical details. The PM's job is to handle  **communication, documentation, and organization** .
* **Myth 2: Only people with a lot of experience within an organization can manage projects successfully.**
  * **Reality:** Success depends on mastering the necessary **skills, knowledge, tools, and techniques** of project management, regardless of previous roles in that organization.
* **Myth 3: You have to know every single detail about the project at all times.**
  * **Reality:** PMs must focus on the **big picture and strategy** (the end goal). They clarify objectives and set expectations. Trusting the team to handle individual task details and communicating openly about risks allows the PM to supervise the overall project goals and remove barriers.

### 2.14 Leadership and team dynamics

* **Interpersonal Skills and Leadership:** Strong interpersonal skills are key to building relationships, understanding team needs, and guiding the team—a huge part of good leadership.
* **Core Concept: Influencing Without Authority:** A project manager’s ability to guide teammates to complete assigned work without acting as their direct manager. This is one of the most critical and challenging aspects of the job.
* **Key Interpersonal Skills for Influencing Without Authority:**
  1. **Communication:** Providing clear feedback and checking in on task progression.
  2. **Negotiation:** Compromising with teammates or stakeholders (e.g., agreeing on a new deadline) to balance their needs with what is best for the project.
  3. **Conflict Mediation:** Developing this skill to address tension and conflict between teammates to prevent the project from suffering.
  4. **Understanding Motivations:** Learning what drives team members (e.g., how they prefer feedback or recognition) and using that individualized information to motivate and encourage them.
* **Career Preparation:** Candidates should be ready to discuss a time they **influenced without authority** during job interviews.
