# Module 2 Legacy Compilation (Superseded)

This file was originally captured as `2.md` mixing multiple Module 2 transcript segments and assessment reflections.

Status:
- Superseded by individually numbered raw transcripts: `2.0.Overview.txt` through `2.16.Wrap-up.txt`.
- Structured synthesis now lives in `1_Project_Files/03_Execution/Course_Notes/Course_1_Foundations.md` under Module 2.

Governance Notes:
- Retained (not deleted) to preserve original capture per raw-first rule.
- Renamed to remove leading numeric pattern so automation (Validate-Sources) excludes it from transcript numbering/gap checks.
- Do NOT cite this file directly in Sources; cite the specific numbered transcripts instead.

If future automation needs to inventory legacy aggregates, search for files ending in `-legacy-compilation.md`.
