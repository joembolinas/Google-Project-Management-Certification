```plaintext
In my understanding, the main difference between **Project Management** and **Program Management** in the context of an organizational chart in workplaces that Program Management is superior than to Project Management.

For example, in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for a large project that possibly has five phases, the **Project Manager** is responsible for the planning and execution of a specific phase. They focus on the details of that project to make sure it meets its objectives. They stick to the plan and follow a linear path, especially in crucial phases like development and testing.

On the other hand, the **Program Manager** oversees all the phases, including development, testing, and refinement. They are responsible for managing each division to ensure they are all aligned with the overall end-goal of the entire program.

Project Manager
The **person** who leads the team. They are responsible for planning, executing, and closing the project. They focus on leadership, communication, and decision-making to guide the project to success.

Project Management
The **process** and methodology. It is the framework of applying knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to meet project requirements. It's the "what you do," while the manager is the "who does it."
```

```
the speaker said, they love what job she has as a Program management, because not for run around and telling what to do to everbody , but because he loves to connect the poeple, resolving conflict, getting experience that can apply in real life
