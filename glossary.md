# Glossary

Central reference for key Project Management terms captured during the Google PM Certificate journey.

> Working Principle: ALL raw capture (transcripts, screenshots, ad‑hoc notes) begins life in `src/` with inline `#gloss:<term>` tags. Curation moves cleaned definitions here only when a term is stabilized (avoid duplication / drift).

## How `#gloss:` Tags Work
- In any raw `src/` transcript or scratch note, append `#gloss:<term>` right after the first occurrence (e.g., `scope baseline #gloss:scope baseline`).
- Use lowercase except proper nouns; prefer singular ("stakeholder" not "stakeholders").
- If the same term appears later, DO NOT tag again unless meaning differs (then consider a qualifier, e.g., `risk appetite` vs `risk capacity`).

## Aggregation Steps (Manual for Now)
1. Grep/search the repository for `#gloss:`.
2. Open each occurrence; confirm the definition context is clear.
3. If new & distinct, add to the Terms table below (alphabetical by term).
4. Replace duplicate full definitions elsewhere with a short pointer: `(See Glossary: <term>)`.
5. During module synthesis, verify each glossary addition is cited in a Sources section.

## Usage Guidance
- Keep definitions concise (≤ 25 words). Focus on what it IS + WHY it matters.
- Prefer action nouns for processes ("change control"), concrete nouns for artifacts ("risk register").
- If two terms risk overlap, choose one canonical term; cross-link the alias: `See: <canonical term>`.
- Avoid copying full sentences from transcripts; instead, synthesize in your own wording.

## Future Automation (Optional)
Potential script ideas:
- Scan `src/` for `#gloss:` tags not yet present here.
- Report duplicate terms with divergent definitions.
