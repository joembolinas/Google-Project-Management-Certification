# Progress Log

## 2025-09-02

- Covered: Added repository banner images (`pm-banner-light.png` + provisional dark duplicate) and integrated <picture> block & badges into README. Verified banner file size (154,974 bytes) below 300KB threshold—no compression required now. Established placeholder for future true dark variant.
- Key Takeaway: Visual identity in README improves quick comprehension and signals project maturity without adding maintenance overhead.
- Next Step: Create Module 3 section stub and begin raw capture (files 3.1–3.2) with initial micro-goal logged via script.

## 2025-09-01 (Later Session)

- Covered: Added Module 3 naming & formatting conventions (end-to-end guide + instructions), extended workflow.json with naming_rules & note_format_standards, migrated resources into README (retired resources.md), updated setup guide (centralized tools), updated copilot instructions with deprecation note, removed obsolete resources.md.
- Key Takeaway: Centralizing conventions and resources reduces maintenance friction and sets a stable scaffold for Module 3 capture & synthesis automation.
- Next Step: Insert Module 3 stub + begin raw transcript capture (3.1–3.2) then log a micro-goal via script.

## 2025-09-01

- Covered: Completed synthesis of Course 1 Module 2 (PM value, roles & responsibilities, interpersonal skills, myths, cross-functional collaboration) and updated journal + course notes.
- Key Takeaway: Effective PM leverage is clarity + facilitation + proactive risk surfacing rather than exhaustive control of technical details.
- Next Step: Begin capture for Module 3 and run glossary extraction to formalize new terms.
