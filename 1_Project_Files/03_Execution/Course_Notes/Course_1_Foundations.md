## Overview

Course 1 introduces foundational project management concepts: what a project is, what project management entails, the role of the project manager, core skills, and the pathway from foundational knowledge to career readiness.

## Key Concepts

- Project vs. Operations: Projects are temporary and unique; operations are ongoing and repeatable.
- Triple Constraint (Scope, Time, Cost) + Quality overlay: balancing trade-offs.
- Life Cycle Phases (introduced high-level): Initiation, Planning, Execution, Closing (Monitoring & Controlling woven throughout in later courses).
- Stakeholders: Individuals/groups affected by or influencing project outcomes.
- Transferable Skills: Communication, organization, problem solving, leadership, time management, adaptability.

## Roles & Responsibilities

Primary PM responsibilities emphasized early:

- Planning & Organizing: Translate objectives into actionable tasks and timelines.
- Leading & Facilitating: Guide team collaboration, resolve conflict.
- Monitoring & Controlling: Track progress, manage risks/issues, adjust plan.
- Communicating: Tailor updates to stakeholder needs; maintain transparency.
- Closing & Learning: Validate deliverables, capture lessons learned.

## Tools & Techniques (Intro Level)

- Basic scheduling (lists / simple tables) before advanced tools (Asana, Sheets) appear later.
- Risk thinking introduced (identify + mitigate) without formal frameworks yet.
- Personal productivity methods reframed as foundational PM capabilities.

## Glossary (Seed)

| Term               | Concise Definition                                                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Project            | Temporary endeavor producing a unique output.                             |
| Project Management | Application of knowledge, skills, tools, techniques to meet requirements. |
| Stakeholder        | Person or group affected by or influencing project outcomes.              |
| Deliverable        | Tangible or intangible verifiable output/result.                          |
| Constraint         | Limiting factor (scope, time, cost, quality, resources, risk).            |

## Reflection

Early emphasis clarifies that PM is a discipline of structured value delivery rather than just task tracking. The framing of everyday experiences (events, school work) as proto-projects helps internalize transferability and builds confidence ahead of more formal methodologies in later courses.
