## Overview

Course 1 introduces foundational project management concepts: what a project is, what project management entails, the role of the project manager, core skills, and the pathway from foundational knowledge to career readiness.

## Key Concepts

- Project vs. Operations: Projects are temporary and unique; operations are ongoing and repeatable.
- Triple Constraint (Scope, Time, Cost) + Quality overlay: balancing trade-offs.
- Life Cycle Phases (introduced high-level): Initiation, Planning, Execution, Closing (Monitoring & Controlling woven throughout in later courses).
- Stakeholders: Individuals/groups affected by or influencing project outcomes.
- Transferable Skills: Communication, organization, problem solving, leadership, time management, adaptability.
 - Role Pathways & Skill Portability (1.11, 1.12): Non-linear entry routes (retail, service, operations) cultivate communication, budgeting awareness, prioritization, and coordination skills. Intentional micro‑project practice (personal trackers, mini plans) builds confidence and reduces imposter syndrome before larger cross‑functional initiatives.

## Roles & Responsibilities

Primary PM responsibilities emphasized early:

- Planning & Organizing: Translate objectives into actionable tasks and timelines.
- Leading & Facilitating: Guide team collaboration, resolve conflict.
- Monitoring & Controlling: Track progress, manage risks/issues, adjust plan.
- Communicating: Tailor updates to stakeholder needs; maintain transparency.
- Closing & Learning: Validate deliverables, capture lessons learned.

## Tools & Techniques (Intro Level)

- Basic scheduling (lists / simple tables) before advanced tools (Asana, Sheets) appear later.
- Risk thinking introduced (identify + mitigate) without formal frameworks yet.
- Personal productivity methods reframed as foundational PM capabilities.

## Glossary (Seed)

| Term               | Concise Definition                                                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Project            | Temporary endeavor producing a unique output.                             |
| Project Management | Application of knowledge, skills, tools, techniques to meet requirements. |
| Stakeholder        | Person or group affected by or influencing project outcomes.              |
| Deliverable        | Tangible or intangible verifiable output/result.                          |
| Constraint         | Limiting factor (scope, time, cost, quality, resources, risk).            |

## Reflection

Early emphasis clarifies that PM is a discipline of structured value delivery rather than just task tracking. The framing of everyday experiences (events, school work) as proto-projects helps internalize transferability and builds confidence ahead of more formal methodologies in later courses.

# Module 2

## Overview

Module 2 expands from foundational what/why into the human and organizational layer: the value a project manager delivers, core recurring responsibilities, interpersonal / leadership competencies, team dynamics, cross‑functional collaboration, and debunking myths that distort expectations. Personal narratives (JuAnne, Rachel, Ellen, Elita) surface real career paths and day‑in‑the‑life insight.

## Key Concepts

- PM Value Proposition: Enable clarity, alignment, flow, and outcome delivery through structured planning, facilitation, and risk anticipation.
- Core Responsibility Clusters: Prioritization, Delegation, Communication, Risk/Issue Management, Stakeholder Alignment, Team Support.
- Interpersonal Levers: Empathy, active listening, psychological safety cultivation, context framing, conflict resolution.
- Cross‑Functional Dynamics: Translating domain perspectives, managing handoffs, clarifying definitions of done, surfacing hidden dependencies early.
- Myths vs Reality: PMs are not “just note takers” or “only scheduling”—they orchestrate value delivery and decision framing.
- Career Path Diversity: Varied entry points (analysis, coordination, operations) converging on transferable systems/people skills.
- Adaptive Competencies: Flexibility, handling ambiguity, resilience under shifting constraints, growth mindset for continuous improvement.

## Roles & Responsibilities (Expanded)

| Responsibility Area | Practical Expression | Outcome Sought |
|---------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Prioritization | Facilitate sequencing workshops; map critical path tasks | Focus on highest impact first |
| Delegation | Match task complexity to strengths; clarify acceptance criteria | Efficient ownership & quality |
| Communication | Tailor cadence & channel to stakeholder needs | Shared understanding / reduced churn |
| Risk & Issue Handling | Surface early signals; log, assess, mitigate | Minimized impact of uncertainty |
| Team Enablement | Remove blockers, ensure resources, advocate capacity | Sustained delivery pace |
| Stakeholder Alignment | Manage expectations; reconcile trade‑offs | Commitment & reduced surprises |
| Continuous Improvement | Retrospectives, lessons routing | Process maturity & learning reuse |

## Core Skills & Competencies

- Flexibility & Ambiguity Handling: Progress with partial information; time-box exploration; articulate assumptions.
- Communication Depth: Switch between executive summary and detailed task context; active listening loops.
- Relationship Building: Trust as accelerant—consistency + follow‑through.
- Leadership Without Authority: Influence via clarity, data, facilitation, and empathy rather than hierarchy.
- Self‑Management: Personal organization systems (task triage, calendar blocking) preventing bottlenecking.
- Emotional Intelligence: Reading team energy; pre‑empting burnout or disengagement.

## Tools / Techniques (Intro Level Extension)

- Responsibility Matrix Lite (who owns / contributes) before formal RACI later.
- Simple Dependency Mapping: Whiteboard or list enumerating upstream blockers.
- Structured Check‑ins: Agenda template (Status / Risks / Decisions Needed / Next Steps).
- Myth Busting Frame: Counter mistaken belief → Provide evidence → Reframe expectation.

## Myths Debunked (Selected)

| Myth | Reality | Implication |
|------|---------|-------------|
| PM = Admin / Scheduler | PM enables strategic alignment & risk navigation | Prioritize synthesis over clerical tasks |
| PM Must Know Every Technical Detail | PM needs enough to ask good questions & sequence | Focus on interfaces & assumptions |
| PM Controls All Outcomes | PM facilitates; delivery shared across team | Promote shared accountability |

## Examples / Scenarios

- Delegation Scenario: Matching a stretch feature to a developing contributor with explicit guardrails accelerates growth while managing risk.
- Cross‑Functional Clarification: Early sync reveals UX dependency on backend schema timing—adjust sprint focus to unblock design iteration.
- Risk Surfacing: Bandwidth instability flagged → mitigation (pre‑download content) prevents slip in study cadence.

## Reflection (Module 2)

Narratives reinforced that effective PM impact is relational leverage + structured facilitation, not command/control. The myth framing helped clarify where to invest energy (clarity, sequencing, psychological safety) and de‑emphasize perfection in technical depth. Key growth focus: sharpen assumption surfacing when ambiguity appears.
