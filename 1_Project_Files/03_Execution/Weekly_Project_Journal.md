# Weekly Project Journal

### Week 2: 2025-08-31 - 2025-09-06

* Tasks Completed:
  * Completed Course 1 Module 2 (value of PM, roles/responsibilities, interpersonal skills, cross-functional dynamics).
  * Synthesized Module 2 structured notes with sources cited.
  * Identified emerging glossary terms (prioritization, delegation, psychological safety, ambiguity tolerance).
  * Reviewed risks; confirmed exam-period mitigation still adequate.
* Challenges:
  * Distilling overlapping soft-skill terms without redundancy.
* Key Learnings:
  * PM impact centers on clarity, flow, and stakeholder confidence more than artifact volume.
  * Myth busting reframes expectations, enabling focus on facilitation & risk navigation.
* Plan Next Week:
  * Begin Module 3 capture; run glossary extraction script to formalize new terms.
  * Evaluate if any new risk needs formal addition (potential glossary backlog).
