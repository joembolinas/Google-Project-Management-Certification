# Lessons Learned Report (Blog Draft)

Version: Skeleton v0.1 – populate only after Course 3 midpoint for early insights; do not finalize until all courses complete.

## Project Overview
Brief recap of goals, scope, timeline, approach (reference Charter & Plan).

## Objectives vs. Outcomes
| Objective | Target | Outcome (TBD) | Notes |
|-----------|--------|---------------|-------|
| Complete 6 Courses | 2026-01-31 |  |  |
| Maintain >90% Score | >90% |  |  |
| Weekly Journal Continuity | No gaps >14 days |  |  |

## Methodology & Adaptations
Describe how planned cadence evolved (any re-baselines, risk responses, study habit tweaks).

## What Went Well
Bullet list – study consistency, early risk identification, artifact discipline.

## Challenges & Responses
| Challenge | Impact | Response | Outcome |
|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| (placeholder) |  |  |  |

## Key Metrics
| Metric | Planned | Actual (TBD) | Source |
|--------|---------|--------------|--------|
| Average Study Hrs/Wk | 6–8 |  | Journal roll-up |
| Schedule Variance (max slip) | ≤7 days |  | Plan change log |
| Risk Count (Open→Closed) | 5→0 |  | Risk Register |

## Top 5 Lessons Learned
Draft later – examples: Importance of structured reflection, proactive buffering, small consistent sessions > large cramming blocks.

## Tooling & Artifacts Value
Describe which artifacts (Risk Register, Journal, Course Summaries) provided the most leverage.

## Image Curation Notes (Progress Log Screenshots)
Source images currently reside under `Foundations of Project Management/image/`. Prior to publication:
- Select only 1–2 representative screenshots (e.g., early progress log, final plan snapshot).
- Export/crop to readable resolution; avoid clutter.
- Move chosen images (or copies) into the eventual public site repo under `assets/images/` with descriptive names (e.g., `foundations_progress_week1.png`).
- Omit redundant intermediate images to keep the narrative concise.

## Skills Strengthened
Map to PM domains: Communication, Risk Management, Scheduling, Stakeholder Thinking, Continuous Improvement.

## Unexpected Insights
Placeholder – note any surprises about pacing, motivation, or methodology fit.

## Next Steps / Application
Planned application to internships, portfolio expansion, deeper Agile practice, maybe CAPM prep.

## Appendix A – Artifact Index
List file paths to final versions of key documents for traceability.
