## 3. Dependencies
- Later course pacing depends on staying within 3-week rhythm early.  
- Capstone quality depends on completeness of prior course artifacts (summaries, journal).  
- Blog draft requires journal continuity.

## 4. Assumptions
- Study windows available evenings + weekends (total 6–8 hrs/week).  
- No major platform outages on Coursera.  
- University midterms primarily impact weeks starting 2025-10-13 and 2025-12-01 (buffer already reflected).

## 5. Constraints
- Single resource (you).  
- Subscription cost encourages steady pace (avoid idle weeks).  
- Holiday period may reduce capacity (late December).

## 6. Monitoring Approach
- Weekly journal entry = progress checkpoint.  
- If any task slips > 7 days, re-baseline timeline (record in Change Log).  
- Risk register reviewed at each weekly reflection.

## 7. Change Log
| Date | Change | Impact | Decision |
|------|--------|--------|----------|
| 2025-09-01 | Logged completion of Course 1 Module 2 synthesis | On track (no re-baseline) | Continue Module 3 capture next |*** End Patch

## 8. Communication Plan (Lightweight)
- Self-updates via journal; milestone recap appended to Charter Approval section when reached.  
- External sharing deferred until Lessons Learned draft.

## 9. Quality Approach
- Consistent section templates for course notes (Key Concepts, Reflection, Sources).  
- Weekly review: completeness of note headings + journal currency.

Document Status: Draft; promote to Baseline v1.0 after Week 1 review.
