**Checklist**

- Answer feasibility of migrating MARM concepts into current repo
- Show how to integrate without overcomplication
- Map existing assets → MARM protocol roles
- Provide phased plan (minimal → advanced)
- Estimate time & complexity per phase
- List challenges + mitigations
- Advise what to defer to avoid getting stuck
- Prompt you for next concrete action

**Feasibility**

- Fully possible. You already have 70% of the “memory substrate” (logs, risks, glossary, automation).
- You do NOT need the full webchat app to benefit; a CLI/Markdown + scripts layer gives 80% of value.
- Start with protocol discipline + automation, defer UI/LLM integration until stable.

**Current Assets → MARM Roles**

- Session Logging: `Weekly_Project_Journal.md` + micro-goal scripts
- Knowledge Library: Course notes + glossary + risk register
- Incident / Accuracy Tracking: `Source_Validation_Incident.txt` (seed accuracy guard pattern)
- Summarization Targets: Risk aging, glossary deltas, weekly journal
- Lifecycle Artifacts: Charter, Lessons Learned (fit reseed + closure phases)
- Automation: Existing PowerShell scripts = command semantics scaffold

**Phased Plan (Lean Adoption)**

- Phase 0 (1–2h): Define protocol spec locally (`MARM_PROTOCOL.md`) adapted to your study workflow; standardize file/folder layout; enforce journal entry format.
- Phase 1 (2–4h): Implement core scripts:
  - `New-Session.ps1` (creates session folder + seed README)
  - `Add-LogEntry.ps1` (validates `[YYYY-MM-DD | Topic | Summary]`)
  - `Export-ReseedBlock.ps1` (journal slice + aging risks + new glossary terms + active goals)
  - `Activate-Notebook.ps1` (select subset of glossary/notes → `active-context.md`)
- Phase 2 (3–6h): Add analytics & cadence:
  - Auto weekly summary insertion
  - Glossary delta detector
  - Risk stale-flag injection into reseed output
- Phase 3 (Optional, 6–10h later): Add lightweight local AI integration (one script calling an API) for optional compression / deep-dive reasoning.
- Phase 4 (Optional, 10h+): UI (web or TUI) / multi-repo academic hub.

**Estimated Effort (Minimal Path)**

- MVP (Phases 0–1): 1 workday (≈4–6 focused hours)
- With Phase 2: + half day
- Full parity with MARM web UI: Not recommended now (would exceed 25–35h)

**Challenges & Mitigations**

- Scope Creep: Freeze initial command set (log, notebook activate, reseed, summary).
- Over-automation: Keep manual checkpoints (weekly summary requires review).
- Format Drift: Add regex validation in `Add-LogEntry.ps1`.
- Cognitive Overhead: Provide a single cheatsheet (`/scripts/_CommandMap.md`).
- Data Fragmentation: Produce one authoritative `active-context.md` used for AI prompts.
- Performance Not Relevant Yet: Avoid premature caching/DB—plain files suffice.

**Minimal Viable Implementation (MVI) Components**

- `protocol/StudyProtocol.md` (adapted MARM commands for academia)
- `notebook/` directory with `topics.md`, `principles.md`, `terms.md`
- `active-context.md` (generated)
- Scripts (initial set):
  - `Add-LogEntry.ps1`
  - `Export-ReseedBlock.ps1`
  - `Activate-Notebook.ps1`
  - (Optional) `List-SessionStatus.ps1` (counts entries, stale risks, new terms)

**Reseed Block Target Structure**

```
# Reseed: Week YYYY-Www (Session: NetworkingFundamentals)
## Focus
Course: Networking Fundamentals | Week: 03 | Active Goal: Build subnetting mastery
## Recent Log (last 5)
2025-09-01 | Subnetting intro | Understood CIDR basics
2025-09-02 | Practice sets | Miscalc on /27 ranges
...
## Stale Risks (>14d)
R-03 Lab environment instability (no mitigation owner)
## New Terms
CIDR: Classless addressing method
Routing table: Lookup structure for next hop
## Active Notebook Keys
study_style, exam_strategy, lab_env
## Next Intent
Drill VLSM | Validate lab reliability | Draft summary by Friday
```

**What NOT To Build Yet**

- Full browser chat client
- AI reasoning trace storage
- Multi-user support
- Complex database backend
- Cross-repo sync (do later when you have multiple term workspaces)

**Risk of Getting Stuck (If You Skip Phasing)**
High—jumping straight to UI + AI adds dependencies, time, and debugging without extra academic value now.

**Decision Matrix (Simple)**

- Need value this week? → Do Phases 0–1 only.
- Want analytics soon? → Add Phase 2 next week.
- Unsure about AI integration? → Defer until you feel friction summarizing manually.

**Time Summary**

- Low-friction path (recommended): 4–6h
- Expanded (with analytics): 8–10h
- Full clone of MARM system: Not justified for current goals yet.

**Next Action Options (Pick One)**

1. Create `StudyProtocol.md` + skeleton scripts (Phase 0 kickoff)
2. Implement `Export-ReseedBlock.ps1` first (fast win)
3. Add log validation to existing journal workflow
4. Generate notebook scaffold + activation script
