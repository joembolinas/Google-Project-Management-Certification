**Checklist**

- Clarify what MARM is vs your current workspace features
- Identify overlaps (conceptual equivalents)
- Identify gaps (what MARM has that yours doesn’t)
- Map your existing artifacts/scripts to “MARM-style” roles
- Suggest how to adapt or enhance your current workflow if you want similar protocol benefits
- Offer optional next steps (you choose if we implement)

**Short Answer**
No, your current workspace is not implementing MARM itself—it’s a structured project management knowledge base (course notes, journals, risk register, glossary tooling). But you already have several components that align conceptually with MARM principles (structured memory, logging, knowledge assets). You could fairly easily layer a lightweight “MARM-inspired” protocol on top of what you have.

**What MARM Is (Essence)**

- A manual protocol for AI session memory control: `/log`, `/summary:`, `/notebook`, `/deep dive`, reseed blocks.
- Focus: reducing drift/hallucination in multi-turn AI use.
- Core mechanics: structured session log → summarized digest → reseed future sessions + selective knowledge injection.

**What Your Workspace Currently Has**

- Risk_Register.md → Structured risk memory.
- Weekly_Project_Journal.md → Ongoing activity log (similar to session log).
- Glossary-Extract.ps1, `Tag-GlossaryCandidates.ps1` → Knowledge extraction pipeline (like `/notebook add:`).
- Add-JournalWeek.ps1, `Update-WeeklyJournal.ps1` → Log scaffolding (parallel to MARM’s manual logging ritual).
- progress-log.md + `Foundations of Project Management/.../progress-log.md` → Status tracking artifacts.
- `Risk-Aging-Report.ps1` → Analytical summarization (akin to a specialized `/summary:`).

**Conceptual Mapping (MARM → Your Repo)**

- Session Log (`/log session:` + `/log entry:`) → Weekly journal + micro-goal entries.
- Notebook (`/notebook add:` curated knowledge) → Glossary + curated course notes + risk register.
- Summary/Reseed (`/summary:` portable digest) → Could be emulated with a script that compiles last week’s journal + high-risk changes + glossary deltas into a single pasteable block.
- Accuracy / Reasoning (`/deep dive`, `/show reasoning`) → You don’t have an AI reasoning transparency layer; closest is manual reflection sections (if added).
- Protocol Toggle (structured vs free) → You informally switch between documenting and learning modes; no explicit toggle script yet.

**Gaps vs MARM**

- No unified “portable reseed block” generator combining journal + key glossary + open risks.
- No command-style interface abstraction (everything done via separate PowerShell scripts + manual editing).
- No deliberate “knowledge activation” subset (MARM’s `use:` concept) to narrow context for a given study/session.
- No summarization cadence enforcement (e.g., auto prompt: “Create summary after X entries”).
- No explicit AI-focused reasoning verification layer.

**Opportunities to Add MARM-Inspired Enhancements**

1. Reseed Block Script
   - New PowerShell: `Export-SessionReseed.ps1`
   - Aggregates: This week’s journal entries (condensed) + top 5 aging risks + newly added glossary terms.
2. Notebook Emulation
   - Designate a file: `knowledge/notebook.md` with sections: Active Principles, Open Focus Areas, Style / Tone Guidelines.
   - Add `Activate-NotebookSection.ps1` to pull selected keys into a temp `active-context.md`.
3. Structured Entry Guard
   - Wrap current journal append script with date/topic validation (enforce `[YYYY-MM-DD | Topic | Summary]`).
4. Weekly Summary Hook
   - Extend `Update-WeeklyJournal.ps1` to append an “AUTO-SUMMARY” section (e.g., bullet compression using heuristic rules).
5. Glossary Activation
   - Tag glossary terms used during the week; include only those in reseed block.
6. Risk Drift Monitor
   - Modify `Risk-Aging-Report.ps1` to flag risks without update in N days → include in reseed block to force attention.

**Example: Proposed Reseed Block Output Format**

```
# Reseed: Week 2025-09-01

## Focus
- Current Module: Course 1 – Foundations
- Active Micro Goal: Complete Risk Register refinement

## Recent Work (Journal Condensed)
2025-09-01 | Charter refined | Stakeholders confirmed
2025-09-02 | Risk review | Added supply chain delay risk
2025-09-03 | Glossary pass | Tagged 12 new terms

## High-Aging Risks (>14 days untouched)
- R-004 Supplier delay – Mitigation unassigned (Aging: 18d)

## New Glossary Terms
- scope creep: Uncontrolled expansion of scope without adjustments
- stakeholder register: Central list of impacted individuals/groups

## Next Intent
- Finish risk prioritization matrix
- Prepare initiation phase summary
```

**Minimal Implementation Path (If You Want It Built)**

- Phase 1: Add new script to compile reseed block.
- Phase 2: Normalize journal entry formatting (regex validation).
- Phase 3: Add glossary delta extractor (compare last snapshot).
- Phase 4: Integrate with existing risk aging script.
- Phase 5: (Optional) Introduce an AI-assisted summarizer later (if you connect to a model).

**Recommendation Based on Your Repository Purpose**
Adopt only the structural disciplines that directly reduce cognitive load: reseed blocks + validated log format + focused active knowledge list. Full MARM command semantics may be overkill unless you integrate an AI chat workflow.

**Your Options Now**

- Want me to draft `Export-SessionReseed.ps1`?
- Or add journal format validation to `Update-WeeklyJournal.ps1`?
- Or produce a `notebook.md` scaffold?

Let me know which enhancement (pick one to start) and I’ll implement it. Just say: “Create the reseed script” (or another choice).
