Self-check

- When would you prefer Agile over a linear plan, and why?

---

Action prompts

- Draft a one-page project charter from a real-life scenario (e.g., move apartments or host an event).
- Create a simple risk register (top 5 risks, owners, mitigations).
- Write a 5–7 sentence story for interviews showing how you managed scope/time/cost trade-offs in everyday life.

Answer key (sample)

- 1.Q1: B. Cost control. 1.Q2: Event planning; moving logistics; retail scheduling, etc.
- 3.Q1: A. Operations Manager. 3.Q2: Core PM processes apply independent of domain; deliver value through planning, execution, and control.
- Other self-checks: reflective/open-ended; compare against definitions above.

### Tips for Reviewing Your Learning Objectives

* **Align objectives with industry-standard definitions** from PMI, APM, etc., to strengthen academic grounding.
* **Add specificity** where possible—e.g., clarify that a project is temporary and unique, bound by constraints.
* **Highlight tools** and methodologies you'll learn to show how they operationalize skills.
* **Emphasize career relevance** —connecting what you learn to recognized certifications and opportunities.
* **Sequence matters** —show that Module 1 is the foundation for later in-depth modules.
